This module takes a date object and a format string and
will create a directory structure based on that format string

Default structure created under target directory
is yyyy/mmmm/yyyy_mm_dd
e.g. 2013/January/2013_01_13
The format is supplied as "yyyy/yyyy_mm_dd".
This will create a directory structure of the format
"2013/2013_01_13" under your target directory.
Where 2013 is a sub-directory under the target
directory and 2013_01_13 is a sub-directory under
2013
